TOPIC: Introduction to thread in c++ (c++11)

QUESTIONS
1. What do you understand by thread and give one example in C++?

ANSWER
0. In every application there is a default thread which is main(), in side this we create other threads.
1. A thread is also known as lightweight process. Idea is achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. 
   For example:
   (a) The browser has multiple tabs that can be different threads. 
   (b) MS Word must be using multiple threads, one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs (spell checker)
   (c) Visual Studio code editor would be using threading for auto completing the code. (Intellicence)

WAYS TO CREATE THREADS IN C++11
1. Function Pointers
2. Lambda Functions
3. Functors
4. Member Functions
5. Static Member functions

Some Notes on threads:
0. If we create multiple threads at the same time, it doesn't guarantee which one will start first

JOIN THREAD NOTES
0. Once a thread is started we wait for this thread to finish by calling join() function on thread object.
1. Double join will result into program termination.
2. If needed we should check thread is joinable before joining. ( using joinable() function)

DETACH THREAD NOTES
0. This is used to detach newly created thread from the parent thread.
1. Always check before detaching a thread that it is joinable otherwise we may end up double detaching and 
   double detach() will result into program termination.
2. If we have detached thread and main function is returning then the detached thread execution is suspended.

NOTES:
Either join() or detach() should be called on thread object, otherwise during thread objects destructor it will terminate the program. Because inside destructor it checks if thread is still joinable? if yes then it terminates the program.
